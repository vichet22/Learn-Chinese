# Vercel Deployment Fix for Advertisement Component

## Issue
Getting `ReferenceError: sampleAds is not defined` when switching routes on Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
This error occurs due to build cache issues where Vercel is using an old cached version of the Advertisement component that doesn't have the `sampleAds` array properly defined.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Clear Vercel Build Cache (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Navigate to your project

2. **Clear Build Cache**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Functions**
   - Click **"Clear Build Cache"** button
   - Confirm the action

3. **Redeploy**
   - Go to **Deployments** tab
   - Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
   - Wait for the build to complete

### Solution 2: Force New Deployment

1. **Make a Small Change**
   - The code has been updated with a comment to force a new build
   - Commit and push the changes

2. **Trigger New Deployment**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Update Advertisement component for Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Solution 3: Use Adsterra Ads Only (Implemented)

I've updated all Advertisement components to use Adsterra ads instead of the sample ads:

- ✅ **Home page**: Already using Adsterra
- ✅ **Vocabulary page**: Updated to use Adsterra
- ✅ **Video page**: Updated to use Adsterra  
- ✅ **Quizzes page**: Updated to use Adsterra

This eliminates the dependency on `sampleAds` and ensures consistent ad display.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Advertisement Component
- ✅ Added error handling for `sampleAds`
- ✅ Added fallback placeholder for missing ads
- ✅ Improved component robustness

### 2. All Pages Updated
- ✅ Home: `<Advertisement type="adsterra" />`
- ✅ Vocabulary: `<Advertisement type="adsterra" />`
- ✅ Video: `<Advertisement type="adsterra" />`
- ✅ Quizzes: `<Advertisement type="adsterra" />`

### 3. Error Handling Added
```jsx
// Ensure sampleAds is defined and is an array
if (!sampleAds || !Array.isArray(sampleAds)) {
  console.warn('sampleAds is not defined or not an array');
  return [];
}
```

## Testing

After deployment, test the following:

1. **Navigate between routes**:
   - Home → Vocabulary ✓
   - Vocabulary → Video ✓
   - Video → Quizzes ✓
   - Quizzes → Home ✓

2. **Check ads display**:
   - Adsterra banners should load on all pages
   - No console errors should appear

3. **Mobile responsiveness**:
   - Ads should adapt to mobile screens
   - No layout issues

## Verification Commands

Run these locally to verify the fix:

```bash
# Check component structure
node verify-ads.js

# Build locally to test
npm run build

# Preview build
npm run preview
```

## Expected Results

✅ **No more `sampleAds is not defined` errors**
✅ **Adsterra banner ads display on all pages**
✅ **Smooth navigation between routes**
✅ **Responsive design on all devices**
✅ **Proper ad loading and fallbacks**

## Support

If you still encounter issues after trying these solutions:

1. Check browser console for any new errors
2. Verify network requests to Adsterra are successful
3. Test in incognito mode to rule out cache issues
4. Contact Vercel support if build cache clearing doesn't work

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Clear Vercel build cache
3. Test all routes thoroughly
4. Monitor ad performance and revenue
